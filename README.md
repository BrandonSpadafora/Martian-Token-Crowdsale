# Unit 21: Martian Token Crowdsale


## Background

After waiting for years and passing several tests, the Martian Aerospace Agency selected you to become part of the first human colony on Mars. As a prominent fintech professional, they chose you to lead a project developing a monetary system for the new Mars colony. You decided to base this new system on blockchain technology and to define a new cryptocurrency named **KaseiCoin**. (Kasei means Mars in Japanese.)

KaseiCoin will be a fungible token that’s ERC-20 compliant. You’ll launch a crowdsale that will allow people who are moving to Mars to convert their earthling money to KaseiCoin.


## Instructions

The steps for this assignment are divided into the following subsections:

1. Create the KaseiCoin Token Contract

2. Create the KaseiCoin Crowdsale Contract

3. Create the KaseiCoin Deployer Contract

4. Deploy and Test the Crowdsale on a Local Blockchain

5. Optional: Extend the Crowdsale Contract by Using OpenZeppelin

    > **Note:** You can choose whether to complete the optional section. It’s designed to further your professional growth and development but won’t be graded as part of this assignment. If you choose to complete this section, you’ll use OpenZeppelin to extend the functionality of your crowdsale contract by adding time restrictions, refund capabilities, and a cap for the number of tokens that can be created. If you have any questions about how to complete the optional section, please reach out to your instructional team.

Note that the provided starter files for this homework assignment contain a `pragma` statement for Solidity version 0.5.0. You’ll use the starter files to complete the steps in the subsections.

In the subsections, you’ll create a fungible token that’s ERC-20 compliant. This token will be minted by using a `Crowdsale` contract from the OpenZeppelin Solidity library.

The crowdsale contract that you create will manage the entire crowdsale process. This process will allow users to send ether to the contract and receive KaseiCoin tokens, or **KAI**, in return. Your contract will automatically mint the tokens and distribute them to a buyer in one transaction.

Note that you’ll record a short video or animated GIF or take several screenshots that show the deployed contract in action.

In the `README.md` file of your GitHub repository for this homework assignment, you’ll create a section named Evaluation Evidence. In this section, you’ll share screenshots of your work from each subsection of the assignment.

### Step 1: Create the KaseiCoin Token Contract

In this subsection, you’ll create a smart contract that defines KaseiCoin as an ERC-20 token. To do so, complete the following steps:

1. Import the provided `KaseiCoin.sol` starter file into the Remix IDE.

2. Import the following contracts from the OpenZeppelin library:

    * `ERC20`

    * `ERC20Detailed`

    * `ERC20Mintable`

3. Define a contract for the KaseiCoin token, and name it `KaseiCoin`. Have the contract inherit the three contracts that you just imported from OpenZeppelin.

4. Inside your `KaseiCoin` contract, add a constructor with the following parameters: `name`, `symbol`, and `initial_supply`.

5. As part of your constructor definition, add a call to the constructor of the `ERC20Detailed` contract, passing the parameters `name`, `symbol`, and `18`. (Recall that 18 is the value for the `decimals` parameter.)

6. Compile the contract by using compiler version 0.5.0.

7. Check for any errors, and debug them as needed.

8. Take a screenshot of the successful compilation of the contract, and add it to the Evaluation Evidence section of the `README.md` file for your GitHub repository.

### Step 2: Create the KaseiCoin Crowdsale Contract

In this subsection, you’ll define the KaseiCoin crowdsale contract. To do so, complete the following steps:

1. Import the provided `KaseiCoinCrowdsale.sol` starter code into the Remix IDE.

2. Have this contract inherit the following OpenZeppelin contracts:

    * `Crowdsale`

    * `MintedCrowdsale`

3. In the `KaisenCoinCrowdsale` constructor, provide parameters for all the features of your crowdsale, such as `rate`, `wallet` (where to deposit the funds that the token raises), and `token`. Configure these parameters as you want for your KaseiCoin token.

4. Compile the contract by using compiler version 0.5.0.

5. Check for any errors, and debug them as needed.

6. Take a screenshot of the successful compilation of the contract, and add it to the Evaluation Evidence section of the `README.md` file for your GitHub repository.

### Step 3: Create the KaseiCoin Deployer Contract

In this subsection, you’ll create the KaseiCoin deployer contract. Start by uncommenting the `KaseiCoinCrowdsaleDeployer` contract in the provided `KaseiCoinCrowdsale.sol` starter code.

Next, in the `KaseiCoinCrowdsaleDeployer` contract, you’ll add variables to store the addresses of the `KaseiCoin` and `KaseiCoinCrowdsale` contracts, which this contract will deploy. Finally, you’ll complete the `KaseiCoinCrowdsaleDeployer` contract. To do so, complete the following steps:

1. Create an `address public` variable named `kasei_token_address`, which will store the `KaseiCoin` address once that contract has been deployed.

2. Create an `address public` variable named `kasei_crowdsale_address`, which will store the `KaseiCoinCrowdsale` address once that contract has been deployed.

3. Add the following parameters to the constructor for the `KaseiCoinCrowdsaleDeployer` contract: `name`, `symbol`, and `wallet`.

4. Inside of the constructor body (that is, between the braces), complete the following steps:

    * Create a new instance of the `KaseiCoinToken` contract.

    * Assign the address of the KaseiCoin token contract to the `kasei_token_address` variable. (This will allow you to easily fetch the token's address later.)

    * Create a new instance of the `KaseiCoinCrowdsale` contract by using the following parameters:

      * The `rate` parameter: Set `rate` equal to 1 to maintain parity with ether.

      * The `wallet` parameter: Pass in `wallet` from the main constructor. This is the wallet that will get paid all the ether that the crowdsale contract raises.

      * The `token` parameter: Make this the `token` variable where `KaseiCoin` is stored.

    * Assign the address of the KaseiCoin crowdsale contract to the `kasei_crowdsale_address` variable. (This will allow you to easily fetch the crowdsale’s address later.)

    * Set the `KaseiCoinCrowdsale` contract as a minter.

    * Have the `KaseiCoinCrowdsaleDeployer` renounce its minter role.

5. Compile the contract by using compiler version 0.5.0.

6. Check for any errors, and debug them as needed.

7. Take a screenshot of the successful compilation of the contract, and add it to the Evaluation Evidence section of the `README.md` file for your Git repository.
